# Getting started with   API
You can use this guide to start using  's APIs.
This document details the available  's API functions and their parameters.

## How it works
Our API is organized around REST. It uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication. Before you get started, there a few things to keep in mind:

When using the POST request, you must specify that content-type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
The default response for all requests is JSON. To use XML, you must change the value for the Accept request header to application/xml.
